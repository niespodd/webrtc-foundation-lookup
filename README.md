# WebRTC Local IP Leak Test üçå

### Lookup tables

This repository includes pre-generated lookup tables for IP-s in subnets:
* `192.168.0.0/16`
* `10.0.0.0/8`
* `172.16.0.0/12`
* (extra) `172.0.0.1` - `172.255.255.1` (`0-255` for the two middle bytes) this allows detection of local WSL subnet on Windows hosts  

The output is split into chunks in `db/[0-999].json.gz` because a single file weights easily over 100-s of MBs and loading such in a browser would be (very likely?) painful. Pardon Github!

Use `python lookup_gen.py` to generate your own. There are (only as little as) `255^4` IPv4 so all possible combinations could be generated as well.
